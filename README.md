# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Project
Analyze and visualize ride-sharing data for PyBer using the power of Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib
## Purpose of new analysis
The purpose of the new analysis was to help Omar create a detailed report which summarizes how ride-sharing data differs by city type! This summary was created by developing a dataframe that summarizes the ride-sharing data by city type and then converting that data into a multiple-line graph depicting the total weekly fares for each city type.
## Results
The results from the pyber summary dataframe indicate that urban cities have more rides and drivers compared to suburban and rural cities. However, because there are more drivers and rides in urban cities, these types of cities tend to have a lower average fare per driver compared to suburban and rural cities, who respecitively have an average fare per driver of about 2.5x and 3.5x more than urban cities.

The results from the multiple-line chart "Total Fare by City Type" depicts the average fare generated for each city type per week from January 2019 to April 2019. The results reveal how rural city types generate the least amount of fare while suburban and urban types tend to generate more fare specifically about 3x and 5x more. For example, the highest amount of fare received for rural city types was $500 during the month of April, while simultaneously for urban city types, the fare amount generated was around $2,400.

## Summary
- **Recommendation #1**
  - Due to the amount of PyBer customers in urban cities and urban cities generating the highest amount of money, increasing the price of fares by as little as $1.00 would generate a huge profit income.
- **Recommendation #2**
  -  One reason rural cities may have the lowest amount of customers could be the due to the lack of drivers in these areas. To combat this issue, it would be beneficial to assign atleast 3x the amount of drivers already present in rural city types. 
- **Recommendation #3**
  - For suburban city types, the multiple-line chart depicts the amount of fare generated increasing during the month of April. This might occur due to children who live in these areas going on spring break or starting summer break, where the need of rides increases. Keeping this increase in mind, it would be beneficial to slightly increase the amount of drivers in suburban areas during the summer months.
